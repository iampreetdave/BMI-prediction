These are the files related to my first project about BMI


BMI-basic.py-
this file uses normal math to find BMI ,it also takes meausre about ethicity to make sure it provides the best result possible


BMI-adv.py-
this file has a advance machine learning model that predicts what category you fall in based on available data, this is just a concept yet not optimized


BMI.ipynb-
both ideas together


bmi.csv-
dataset for bmi
